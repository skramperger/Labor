## Overview

This repository contains all programs written for Arduino hardware using PlatformIO and Visual Studio Code. The projects focus on controlling various hardware components and sensors.

## Repository Structure

The repository includes the following files:

- **7_segment_display_config.circ**: Configuration file for a 7-segment display.
- **led_control.cpp**: Program to control an LED.
- **led_running_light.cpp**: Program to create a running light effect using LEDs.
- **levitator_sinus.cpp**: Program for controlling a levitation device using sinusoidal signals.
- **ultraschall_sensor.cpp**: Program for interfacing with an ultrasonic sensor.

## Getting Started

To use the programs in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repositoryname.git` and navigate to the project directory.
2. Open the project in PlatformIO:
   - Install PlatformIO in Visual Studio Code.
   - Open the cloned repository folder in PlatformIO.
3. Compile and Upload the programs:
   - Connect your Arduino hardware to your computer.
   - Use PlatformIO to compile and upload the desired program to the Arduino.
